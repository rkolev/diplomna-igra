Bachelor's degree project in the form of a simple 2D sidescrolling action game

This little game is a project made by Daniel Milkov and Rumen Kolev for their join bachelor's degree project.
The state of the code is quite questionable, as the currently committed files are just the two branches used
at project defense merged into one and cleared of compile time errors. It is entirely possible that the game
will not run properly (or at all) in its current form, something that I will try to fix in the near future.

The project requires ClanLib precompiles to compile at all.
